List of ongoing bugs/issues:

1. (RESOLVED) When the hamburger menu appears by sliding down,
it briefly covers the icon.
    > attempted to fix by setting icon to have a
    higher z-index than the menu, but that did not
    work.

2. (RESOLVED -> used online free icons instead) Some canva icons are still watermarked.

3. The responsiveness to desktop vs. mobile kid of breaks down at the inbetween stage, but looks fine when its at either end.
Also, the buttons align slightly differently on web-simulated mobile vs actual mobile.

4. The search buttons are slighty misaligned w phone screen vs laptop simulation of phone screen
